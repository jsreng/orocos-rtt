    This document provides a quick overview of what changed between
    the Real-Time Toolkit &oldversion; and version &version;. This
    release includes all bugfixes of the &oldversion; branch. If your
    application does not work with this release, look here for
    possible causes and solutions. Also feature additions and
    improvements are documented.

	    A thread creation bug (a regression) was fixed when running in the gnulinux target and no

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname> has gained a
	    new default execution model. Previously, a newly created
	    TaskContext object could not be started and had no
	    activity assigned. With this release, each created
	    TaskContext gets automatically a
	    <classname>RTT::SequentialActivity</classname> assigned,
	    which allows it to start running and process commands and
	    events. There is no thread created for this Activity,
	    the commands and events are processed in the thread of the
	    caller (thus sequentially). This activity implementation is equally
	    thread-safe as the other RTT activities. See the Component Builder's Manual for
	    an example.

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The TaskContext has gained <classname>RTT::Event</classname>
	    based Data and Buffer port processing. This allows non-periodic
	    or sequential TaskContext objects to wake up when input on plain data ports arrives.
	    A new function <function>ports()->addEventPort( &amp;a_port, "Description")</function>
	    has been added to the interface to register a port for event-based
	    reception. See the Component Builder's Manual for an example.

	  <para>
	    The <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname> interface gained
	    a <function>getActivity()</function> function which always returns
	    a valid object and is equivalent to the old notation
	    <function>engine()->getActivity()</function>. Further more, the
	    <function>setActivity(ActivityInterface* )</function> function has
	    been added to assign an activity to a TaskContext. The TaskContext
	    <emphasis>owns</emphasis> the assigned activity object and manages memory
	    allocation. The new usage pattern is then for example: 
	    <programlisting>  a_task.setActivity( new PeriodicActivity(0.01) );</programlisting>

	    The <classname>RTT::Logger</classname> class has been extended such that
	    it can be queried for the current 'log message' time. The OCL
	    ReportingComponent can use this to synchronise data logs with message
	    logs.

	    This release is binary incompatible with OCL

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The interface of the <classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname> changed slightly.
	    <function>kickOut(void)</function> has been renamed to <function>kickOutAll(void)</function>
	    and two new functions <function>kickOut(std::string file_name)</function>,
	    <function>kickOutComponent(std::string comp_name)</function> which unload a series
	    of components described in a file or a single component by name respectively.
	    This was done for equivalence with the <function>kickStart*</function> methods.

      <title>Improvements</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <classname>OCL::DeploymentComponent</classname> has better
	    support for unloading/reloading components using XML files and
	    error handling during the configuration steps. Loading additional
	    components in a configured and running system is now possible.
	  </para>
	  <para> Contributed by D. Faconti </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para> The DeploymentComponent gained the ability to use
	  <option>LoadProperties</option> (in addition to the
	  <option>UpdateProperties</option> and
	  <option>PropertyFile</option> elements) in the XML
	  configuration file. This allows to load new properties into
	  any existing component. </para>
	  <para>Finally, a <option>Properties</option> element has
	  been added in case you want to set (default) properties in
	  the deployment XML file. This makes the use of an external
	  property file optional.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    It is now possible to specify which component is
	    <emphasis>Master</emphasis> when specifying a Slave
	    activity in the deployment XML file. Also, each slave
	    becomes automatically a peer of its master.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The Deployment component now looks for a 'site local' XML file
	    in the current directory. This allows to pre-set the component
	    path and load local libraries or site specific components.
