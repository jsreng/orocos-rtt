The target files in this directory contain the defines which were
enabled when the orocos-rtt-<target> library was built.  You require
these defines when including RTT headers in your application.

One target file is included by rtt-target.h, which was included by
rtt-config.h. Target files may be hand written or automatically be
generated by the RTT build system and describe which features were on
or off and which OS layer was selected.

This directory structure allows to have multiple configurations
(targets) share the same header files in the same location. The user
can choose a configuration by setting -DOROCOS_TARGET=<target> where
<target> is a filename in this directory, for example:

  -DOROCOS_TARGET=lxrt

When the pkg-config tool is used to query for the --cflags, the
-DOROCOS_TARGET option is automatically presented. In case no
OROCOS_TARGET define is given, a default is selected.

This system was introduced to ease packaging and installing for
multiple targets on the same system, in the same directory structure.
