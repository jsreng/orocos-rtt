   * @brief The base class for all internal::DataSource's
   *
   * The internal::DataSource is an object containing Data of any type. It's
   * interface is designed for dynamic build-up and destruction of
   * these objects and allowing Commands, Properties etc to use them
   * as 'storage' devices which have the dual \a copy() /\a clone() semantics
   * (which is heavily used by the Orocos Task Infrastructure).
   *
   * @important internal::DataSource's are reference counted and must be allocated on the headp. Use
   * DataSourceBase::shared_ptr or internal::DataSource<T>::shared_ptr to deal
   * with cleanup of allocated DataSources. You are not allowed to delete
   * a DataSource. If you must have the pointer of a internal::DataSource, use
   * the \a .get() method of the \a shared_ptr class.
   *
   * Once a newly created internal::DataSource is assigned to a \a shared_ptr,
   * it will be deleted when that pointer goes out of scope and is not
   * shared by other \a shared_ptr objects.
   *
   * @see internal::DataSource

         in the class itself.  Advantages are that the shared_ptr's for
