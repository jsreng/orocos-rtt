    class RTT_API TaskCore
    {
    public:
        /**
         * Describes the different states a component can have.  When
         * a TaskContext is being constructed, it is in the \a Init
         * state. After the construction ends, the component arrives
         * in the \a PreOperational (additional configuration
         * required) or the \a Stopped (ready to run) state. Invoking
         * \a start() will make a transition to the \a Running state
         * and \a stop() back to the \a Stopped state. The \a Running
         * state executes the \a updateHook() and processes events and
         * commands. Invoking \a activate() will make a transition to
         * the \a Active state in which only events and commands are
         * processed. Within the \a Active state: \a start() will
         * continue to the \a Running state, and a \a stop() will go
         * back to the \a Stopped state. Finally, there is an \a
         * FatalError state, in which the component can enter by
         * calling the protected method \a fatalError(). In this
         * state, the ExecutionEngine is stopped and \a updateHook()
         * is no longer called.  The public \a resetError() method allows one to
         * leave the \a FatalError state and enter the \a Stopped
         * state, or if the error is unrecoverable, the \a
         * PreOperational state.
         *
         * Next to the fatal error, two run-time error levels are
         * available in the \a Running state as well. These levels
         * allow 'automatic' recovery by the component in case the
         * problem is temporal. When the task is \a Running, it may
         * call the protected \a warning() method in order to signal a
         * possible problem. In this \a RunTimeWarning substate, the \a
         * updateHook() is still called. One can leave this substate
         * by calling the protected \a recovered() method. In case of
         * more severe problems, one may call the protected method \a
         * error() when the component is \a Running. The component
         * will enter the \a RunTimeError state and will cause the \a
         * errorHook() to be called instead of \a updateHook(). When
         * \a recovered() is called, this run-time error state is left
         * and the nominal \a Running state is entered again.
         *
         * In order to keep track of these run-time errors, a counter
         * is provided for each sub-state indicating how many times it
         * was entered. See getWarningCount() and getErrorCount().
         *
         * In order to check if these transitions are allowed, hook functions
         * are executed, which can be filled in by the component builder.
         * - A transition from \a PreOperational to \a Stopped is checked
         * by calling the \a configureHook() method. If this method returns \a true,
         * the transition is made, otherwise, the state remains \a PreOperational.
         * - A transition from \a Stopped to \a Running is checked by calling
         * the \a startHook() method. If this method returns \a true,
         * the transition is made, otherwise, the state remains \a Stopped.
         * - A transition from \a Stopped to \a Active is checked by calling
         * the \a activateHook() method. If this method returns \a true,
         * the transition is made, otherwise, the state remains \a Stopped.
         * - A transition from \a Active to \a Running is checked by calling
         * the \a startHook() method. If this method returns \a true,
         * the transition is made, otherwise, the state remains \a Active.
         * - A transition from \a Running to \a Stopped is always allowed
         * and the \a stopHook() method is called to inform the component of
         * this transtion.
         * - A transition from \a Active to \a Stopped is always allowed
         * and the \a stopHook() method is called to inform the component of
         * this transtion.
         * - A transition from \a Stopped to \a PreOperational is always allowed
         * and the \a cleanupHook() method is called to inform the component of
         * this transtion.
         * - A transition from the \a FatalError state to the \a Stopped state
