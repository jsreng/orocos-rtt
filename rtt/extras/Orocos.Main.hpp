/**
 * @mainpage RTT Online API Documentation
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * This is the Online API documentation of the Orocos Real-Time Toolkit.
 *
 * @section recom Recommendation
 * It is easiest to browse the classes by modules, to not
 * loose the overview. Click for example on the
 * <a href="modules.html"><tt>Modules List</tt></a>
 * link, select a module and then you get the most important classes
 * for this module.
 *
 * You will most likely also need to read the <a href="http://www.orocos.org/rtt/">online manuals</a>.
 *
 * @section corelib Real-Time types::Toolkit classes (RTT)
 *
 * The classes in the RTT namespace form the application independent
 * control services which defines the portable framework for
 * defining software components.
 *
 * A component is implemented using the RTT::TaskContext class. The
 * Component interface consits of five parts: events: RTT::Event, commands:
 * RTT::Command, methods: RTT::Method, properties: RTT::Property,
 * RTT::Attribute and data ports: RTT::InputPort, RTT::OutputPort.
 *
 * A Component is run by an RTT::Activity 
 * which attaches a thread to the component's private Execution Engine.
 * The RTT::ExecutionEngine is the beating heart of each
 * component which executes the the application code, reacts to
 * events, processes commands etc.  Scripting is enabled by the
 * scripting::ScriptingAccess, XML can be read by the
 * interface::MarshallingAccess. Many other classes are available as well.
 *
 * @section rttcorba CORBA support (network communication)
 *
 * Components can be connected over a network using the CORBA classes.
 * Only two classes are required: RTT::corba::ControlTaskServer and
 * RTT::corba::ControlTaskProxy. The former exports a local TaskContext instance
 * to the network, using the CORBA Naming Service if available, the latter
 * represents a remote TaskContext (located using the name or IOR) and allows
 * local TaskContexts to communicate with the remote instance.
 *
 * The RTT must be compiled with the --enable-corba flag in order to
 * enable this extension.
 *
 * @section devdrivers Hardware Access and Device Interface
 *
 * Orocos has an abstraction layer and some utility classes to access
 * common devices (IO, encoders,...) from applications. The Device
 * Interface headers can be found in rtt/extras/dev.
 *
 * The device drivers are not implemented by the RTT, but provided by components.
 * See the Orocos Components Library (OCL) documentation for a list of supported
 * devices and examples.
