     *
     * The default policy of the CommandProcessor is to dequeue one
     * command in each step() and execute it. If you want to change
     * this policy, subclass the CommandProcessor and override the
     * virtual functions, such as step() or process().  The current
     * command queue is non blocking for push and pop operations.
     * process() fails when the queue is full; step() does nothing
     * when the queue is empty. A subclass may install a new
     * command queue with for example blocking semantics.
