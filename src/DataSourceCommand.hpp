   * A class that wraps a Command in a DataSource<bool>

   * The encapsulated command is an Action. Renaming could be
   * an option. Each get() executes the Action and returns the bool.
   * Used for example for assignments, which may fail in complex types.
   * Also used by CORBA Operations in combination with MethodC and updateCommand
   * to store the result of a method in another data source. The MethodC
   * then executes the updateCommand, which in turn calls the real method and then
   * stores the result.
